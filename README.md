# JM Tech & Development

### Introduction

JM Tech & Development (JMTD) is a fictional blog site for developers and technology enthusiasts. 
This full-stack application allows the user to create / delete both blog posts and comments.
JMTD utilizes RESTful architecture and performs CRUD operations for the user (depending on his/her 
authorization/ownership). This app is connected to a MongoDB (NoSQL Database) cluster which allows 
data to get stored. Errors are handled through flash messages to provide the user with feedback.
